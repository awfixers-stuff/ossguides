# AWFixer Open Source Guides

## Preamble

{% hint style="success" %}
if you want to support me and help me hire a team to help work on these projects, you can join the [Patreon](https://patreon.com/awfixer)
{% endhint %}

This website is meant to allow me to say things like RTFM when i reply to people in PRs, Issues and Discussions. It only works if there are docs, guides and manuals for them to read - so here it is.

### What you will find here:

you will find info and documentation about how we use various tools, expectations in the PRs that you make, how we protect and profile our code and so on. This is meant to allow you to take a good-first-time issue and turn it into a PR that will not only make us happy, but also make us happy to see you coming around again and again to contribute to our codebase, it also serves to take busywork of answering questions off of our normal contributors, so when you start contributing you do not spend most of your time answering questions and can instead focus on writing cool quality code.

### What you will not find here:

detailed guides on basically anything. We will reference docs for anything as this is just meant to help you not teach you everything about everthing.



if you are looking for technical information about each repo we also maintain the wiki on github, which will allow you to see technical notes about things like code and design ideas we have and how we are implementing them.

## Our Discord

you can join the discord for any questions that you may have. We love to help you help us <3

### AWFixer and Friends CTA:

This Project is necessary since toxic elements within OSS projects, moles from BigTech, are boycotting any substantial work, in order to destroy the "projects", to eliminate competition of their own products. Classic "embrace, extend, extinguish" tactics.

This is an independent project, not at all affiliated with BigTech or any of their subsidiaries or tax evasion tools, nor any political activists groups, state actors, etc. It's explicitly free of any "DEI" or similar discriminatory policies. Anybody who's treating others nicely is welcomed.

It doesn't matter which country you're coming from, your political views, your race, your sex, your age, your food menu, whether you wear boots or heels, whether you're furry or fairy, Conan or McKay, comic character, a small furry creature from Alpha Centauri, or just a boring average person. Anybody who's interested in bringing AWFixers Stuff forward is welcome.

Together we'll make FOSS great again!

## Happy Hacking!
