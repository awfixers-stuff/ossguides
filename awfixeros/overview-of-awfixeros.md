# Overview of AWFixerOS

{% hint style="success" %}
I am the only person working on AWFixerOS at this time so anything that I want to do on the project as noted [here](https://paper.awfixeros.site/roadmap-and-goals) it is all approximated and based on what i know, what I have to learn, what needs to be done, and of course the time and money that I have on hand to work on it.
{% endhint %}

### What is AWFixerOS?

because I am not in the mood to repeat myself, you can find more information on the paper site.

The point of AWFixerOS is pretty simple. Windows sucks, we have been waiting for the year of the Linux desktop for as long as we have been waiting for gavin newsom to end homelessness in California - and I have literally no faith that either platform is going to change.

so I decided that I was going to make my own. Written in rust and nix with an elixir server built to handle off device connections in a private, secure, and efficient manor. It is going to do everything they can do, but i can do it better.
