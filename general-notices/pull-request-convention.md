# Pull Request Convention

{% hint style="success" %}
When you open a pull request against one of our branches in a project, it may tell you to read this in the closure message
{% endhint %}

I personally handle pull requests in a specific way - and since i am the org admin i am able to do that. I will explain how I do it below and add comments about how you can avoid being punished for my bad habits ;p
