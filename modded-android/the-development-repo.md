# the Development Repo

### What is the development Repo?

the development repo is home to tools that can be used to build, test and monitor you changes to modded android on your local machine.&#x20;

We are working on integrating things like nix flakes, makes, and other tools that will allow you to work on the projects on a variety of hardware. This will help open contributions to everyone and lower the barrier to entry for people who would like to help.
